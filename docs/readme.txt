Installation:
=============

Transfer all files to your desired folder on your webspace. Open "install/install.php" and
follow the install instructions. After a successfull install delete the directory "install".
This is VERY IMPORTANT! So do it! You can rename it too.

For more Details see here:
--------------------------
https://www.m-gb.org/wiki/doku.php/installation (ONLY GERMAN, sorry)


Upgrading:
==========

If you want to upgrade from any previous 0.6.x Version to this, open "install/upgrade.php"
AFTER copying all new files over your old installation. If you created your own style for the mgbModern
Template, you may have to update your style.css.

IMPORTANT:
If you want to update from MGB 0.5.x then you must upgrade to the latest 0.6.x first. There is no way to update
directly to 0.7.x. Sorry, but 0.5.x is too old!


Translating:
============

I need some good translators for every language you can imagine. Even english. My english
is not very well, so please help me! You can start translating the language files included
in this version. Mail your finished translation to me: mopzz@m-gb.org


Templates:
==========

You can create your own templates and email it to me. You have to release it under GNU/GPL, otherwise
i cannot support them. There will be a manual in a few weeks, that explains how to do your own template
for persons who are not so familiar with things like that.
